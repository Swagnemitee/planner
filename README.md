# Planner

This is a web app that helps you **plan and track your days**. Keeping track of your tasks and visualizing them can increase your productivity and help you build habits. It has an **intuitive and easy** to use interface that you can costumize.

The web app is hosted at [planner.ozansap.com](https://planner.ozansap.com). \
It is designed for use on a large screen, it does not work on mobile.

##### I do not have access any kind of data. All data is stored on your device locally.

## Features

- [x] - **Create tasks** and keep track of them as you complete
- [x] - Insert tasks into lists that be can **automatically reset every day, week or month**
- [x] - **Organize lists into groups** to keep your planner tidy and coherent
- [x] - **Drag and drop** tasks, lists and groups to quickly edit your planner
- [x] - **Undo and redo** every action to correct your mistakes

## How to Use

* Click on the plus sign on upper right corner to create a group
* Hovering the mouse over a group or list name creates two buttons that can be pressed to edit that group or list
* Click on the plus sign on a group to create a list in that group
* Click on the plus sign on a list to create a task in that group
* Click on the three dots to edit a list or a group
* Click on the number next to a task to complete that task once
* Click on a task's name to edit that task
* Click on the left arrow on upper right corner to undo the last change
* Click on the right arrow on upper right corner to redo the last undo

## Future Plans

If I continue working on this, there are a few features I want to implement:

- [ ] - Users can assign a value to tasks and they will be awarded with points when they complete these tasks
- [ ] - Users can add goals to groups and achieve them by earning a certain amount of points in that group
- [ ] - Keep track of the amount of points received on a daily, weekly and monthly basis
- [ ] - Users can check their past points and compare to their current progress

## Significance

This is my third webapp. I built this webapp because I wanted to have a planner that I can use daily. I searched many planners but I couldn't find one with the features that I wanted. That's why I wanted to create a simple webapp with a simple and intuitive UI and the features that I want. I use this planner daily in order to build habits and organize and plan my days. For this project I again decided to use React because I wanted to become more efficient at working with it.

I also used many libraries in order to simplify my work. I learned how to navigate and learn completely new libraries and products. Such as dayjs to work with dates and lodash to work with objects and arrays. I feel like being able to understand new products by reading the documentation is an important skill.

I wanted to also learn how to implement TypeScript into this project. I was already familiar with types thanks to Java and Having typed variables was really useful. Not only can I identify type related bugs before testing, but I also get better support for my IDE. Visual Studio Code has lots of useful tools that make developing with TypeScript easier and faster. I don't think I will ever use JS without TS again. 

## Technologies Used

* [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) to build the website
* [TypeScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) to make JavaScript type enforced
* [dayjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dayjs) to take care of dates
* [sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) to have cleaner CSS files
* [react-beautiful-dnd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-beautiful-dnd) to handle the drag and drop function
* [lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash) to deal with objects and arrays easier
